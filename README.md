## Overview  
*Bartertown* is an online trading site where users may find anything another user is wanting to trade and can propose their own trades. Once a trade has been proposed, other users may leave comments on the item's show page as well as make a bid or bids for that item with their own items. Those bids can also be commented upon by the community users. If the owner of the original trade proposal likes one of the bids, they can then decide to make a deal, which will create a private line of communication between the two users and will remove both items of the trade from the community.
